# About this flake

Warming:  this a personal experiment while on my path learning Flakes.  Do not recommend to use.


This particular Flakes allows you to fetch the lastest packages for Youtube Music from Github's Master source. 

To obtain the lastest version of Youtube Music we just need to change versions numbers and get the Sha256 hash in 32bit that correspond to that particular version.
