# Personal Nix Configuration

For exclusive use of reproducibility, this is a highly/stable and personal configuration of my NixOS system on KDE Plasma 6 desktop environment it is exclusively adapted for communication, Virtual Machine Management, isolated development and Cloud-Gaming with Geforce Now  employing a clean app made with Chromium as main client. 

By default it includes [Nix Software Center](https://github.com/snowfallorg/nix-software-center) to simplified packages installation, configuration sets for the use of Virt-Manager with virtualization activated, autoclean,autoupdate set and the annoying password prompt disable in terminal.

Other activated options:

- [ ] steam activated
- [ ] flatpak activated
- [ ] plymouth activated
- [ ] nix flakes activated
- [ ] non-free packages activated
- [ ] ventoy installed with GUI issue fixed

Personally i do not recommend to copy and paste an entire configuration.  Study, analyze, pick what you need it and paste to your configuration.

In the case you ignore this warning, by default this particular system will always boot and login to desktop without password prompts.
