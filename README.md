## NixOS Configuration Overview

ðŸ’¡ About this set up

- Personal configuration of my NixOS environment featuring KDE Plasma 6 as main desktop, SDDM login manager with automatic login for user. It work with proprietary NVIDIA driver and full hardware acceleration for 32-bit support for gaming. The system is optimized for a desktop with TLP and thermald for power and thermal control, while disabling sleep functions. Steam and Flatpak are enabled, and unfree packages are allowed. Nix garbage collection runs daily, and the Flakes feature is activated for modern package management.
