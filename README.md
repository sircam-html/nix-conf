# Personal Nix Configuration

For exclusive use of reproducibility, this is a highly/stable and personal configuration of my NixOS system on KDE Plasma 6 desktop environment it is completely adapted for communication, Virtual Machine Management, isolated development (devenv) and Cloud-Gaming with Geforce Now employing a clean web-app made with Chromium.. 

By default it includes several and important configurations like virtualization for the use of Virt-Manager,autoclean,autoupdate and the annoying password prompt completely disable in terminal.

Others activated options are:

- [ ] Steam activated
- [ ] Flatpak activated
- [ ] Plymouth activated
- [ ] Nix flakes activated
- [ ] Non-free packages activated

Personally i do not recommend to copy and paste an entire configuration.  Study, analyze, pick what you need it and paste to your configuration.

In the case you ignore this warning, by default this particular system will always boot and login to desktop without password prompts.
